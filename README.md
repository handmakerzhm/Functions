# Functions

Introductory to functions and basic concepts

A reference for function information and examples. Functions can be used in may ways with a 
combination of other variables, objects, functions etc ...

I need to practice more with defining my classes better and passing parameters to other functions. 
Main goal is to understand how to use them more efficiently and effectively. Simplifying 
the different functions in ways that I can understand. In the past it was difficult to understand 
the different types of functions as well as the purpose for each type of function.  Later on I took notes 
then classified them to the best of my knowledge, while still learning the mysterious nature of functions.

There will be updates in the future. A personal placeholder for me to return to.
